GitHub Profile (Older Projects)
Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, you will find a collection of my older projects, including work in software development, artificial intelligence, natural language processing (NLP), and various programming languages such as C, C#, and Java. These projects have played a crucial role in building my skills and gaining experience across multiple domains.

Key Projects:
NLP-Based Translation App: A translation tool that leverages natural language processing techniques to provide accurate and context-aware translations.

Chatbot Development Project: My first GPT-based chatbot that can understand user queries and provide meaningful responses. This project helped me build foundational knowledge in AI-driven conversational systems.

Text Classification Project: Using the healthcare dataset, I developed a model to categorize and classify text. This project enhanced my machine learning skills in supervised learning.

C, C#, and Java Projects: As part of my software engineering journey, I worked on various projects using C, C#, and Java, which helped me gain experience in algorithms, data structures, and software architecture.

Signal Processing Projects: I applied fundamental concepts such as convolution and Laplace transforms in these projects, which were a key part of my computer science education.

Personal AI Projects: These include small-scale AI experiments and prototypes aimed at solving different problems, such as automated response generation and data analysis.

Feel free to explore these older projects to see how my journey in software and AI development has evolved. I am continuously learning and growing, and these projects reflect the experiences I've gained along the way.
